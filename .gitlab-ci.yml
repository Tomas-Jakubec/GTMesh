# Stages are useful only to enforce some ordering of the jobs. Every job is run
# in its own directory and only very few data can be shared between the jobs in
# different stages. It has to be zipped and uploaded to the server, so we can't
# do it with the build directory. Hence, we must build, test and install in the
# same job.
